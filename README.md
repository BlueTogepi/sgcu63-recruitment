# SGCU63 Front-end/Back-end Engineer Recruitment Answers

Programming Langauge: Python3
Specification: python=3.7.7

For Prob#2 and Prob3, built-in stardard library is used, so the answer files are uploaded alone
For Prob#1, third-party libraries are used as followed:
  - beautifulsoup4=4.9.0
  - requests=2.23.0

If needed, the conda environment package is attached inside the Prob#1 folder ("prob1_env.yml")
Note: it is actually that all of the 3 prob answers use the same conda environment, though Prob#2 and Prob#3 don't use the third-party libraries
